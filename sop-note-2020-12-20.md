# The SOP note (2020-12-20)
The note is resulted from proggresive thinking during the development.

## Preface

The note of this new test is based on the former one (test-and-run) in a proper
decoration:

```test
[>]  || start or play
  if you to this to me, I am ok.  || yes or no; yes and no
  if you to this to me, I'm ok.   || likely yes/no; yes;no; yes|no; yes&no

  [||]
    For script preparation...
  [>] resume

  if you to that to me, I'm ok.   || this is the current time of context
  if you to that to me, I am ok.  || that is the clone of this in anther closure.
[[]]  || stop or finish
```


## Operator cheatsheet

The cheatsheet provide here is not for the survey but for quick references.

1. Simple conjuction: and, or, not;
2. Basic logics: `and`, `or`; not-and (`nand`), note-or(`nor`);
3. Exclusive basic: exclusive-or (`xor`); exlusive-nor (`nxor`);
4. Reduce basic: reduce-or ('ror'); reduce-not-or and reduce-nor (`nror`);
5. conjuection `but` and logic `but`.


## Draft for this test
It is incomplete or misleading. It is introduce here for the following
test (test-and-run): predicate-like conjunction: else.. then.. or.. otherwise.

```test
<< Hello World . sop >>
[>]
  If you to this to me, I am ok;  || semicolon (;) introduction
  else if you can do this, I'm ok.  || keyword (else) with if keyword stack and
                                    || assistant verb (can) duo-introduction

  || Western entrance of subject-orient formulation.
  I am ok if you do this to me.
  I am OK if you do this to me!  || claimation mark
  I am O.K. if you do this to me!  || remark
