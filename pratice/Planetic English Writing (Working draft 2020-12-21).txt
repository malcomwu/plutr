## Introduction
(It is draft. To be filled...)


## Untitled or named or titled (one or more)
(It is draft. To be filled...)


## Template for the test

It is a context here in this doc. The play [>] or start [>] is in the following
macro templete. Make it work in several iteration of scripting and/or programming.
The macro is a test in rehersal for preparation. It shall loopback to your current
loop as of, but we wish make it more well-defined by the practice.

(The context here is denoted this and it is possible going to that. The author wants
to secure this.)

```test
<< title . sop >>

[>]  || start this (the context)
  this  || initialize it in batch, init(), or with parameter, initWith(a, b, ...)
  ...  || programming in concise

  [||]
    ... ... ...  || scripting in vervose
  [>]
  this/that  || switch(es)
  ...
  that  || this is overwhelmed by that
  ...
  ...

  [||]
    ... ... ...
  [>]
  ...

  this  || @_@.. || neither this nor that
  return $  || default value of $ is in [[]]; -1 for error for testing purposes.

[[$ = -1]]  || prepare for launch
```

This come back in the context, this, again. The $ in [[$]] is the value of $ and
The default value is described in [[$ = -1]]. The -1 means error here this is
because we all want to break it now but our momentum and momenta still here.

Please fill the untitled and add anything else in context and then go into the
templet of macro [>] .. [||] .. [[$ = -1]]. Do it back-and-forth as ususal as you
used to. The common sense for this is only a single one, and others are backup. We
want money, um~, but not quite so. We want to make money.


## Untitled or named or titled (one or more)

## Note

The idea is crucial and very important for us to pratice and without exercise. It
only makes you feeling fresh or refreshing yourself. In funcional thinking:

                   1 + 2 * 3 = 1 + (2 * 3) = 7.                             [1]

In macro thinkg we focus on here is by the definition: 

                    Define ADD(a, b)     a + b                              [2]

By substuting of variables, ADD(1, 2) * 3 = 1 + 2 * 3 = 7; however, it should be
3 * 3 = 9. A good pratice is do (ADD(1, 2)) * 3 = 9 in paranthesis so that the sub-
stution becomes (1 + 2) * 3 = 9 and it works everywhere without the flaw above.
This is because you are not sure that, wether the macro writer care of this. There-
fore, because we are in the same front, the wave front, and please follow the best
pratice in,

** Psuedo-code**

```psuedo
                          ADD(a, b) :=: (a + b)
```

**Macro**

```test
<<< SCRIPT_A >>>  || print console

SCRIPT_A(b, c)
  [$b||]  || b can be affacted in this script
  ...
  [$c>]  || result c; loop c back in the program
```

**Program**

```test
<< Planetic English Writing >>  || print screen

[>]
  ...
  $d <= SCRIPT_A(b, c)  || map c back-in and stored in d for testing purposes
  ...
[[$ = -1]]
```
The dataflow of $ or the program maintains the same, but the script(s) have data-
flow(s) of $'s.


## Case study

1. Natural, not natural and unnatual in nature [1] (Reference [1] is of the
   template here).

2. Natural, anit-natural and violence/violalation of the natural [1]. (Analogy:
   Superstitious vs. rediculous)


## Appendix A

    The appendice is a pratice to be tested, for doctors (abstraction title) to cure
the patients. First, introduce your guidance to your patient; second, provide the
guideline or better your guideline to him or here.

It shall go on an you may want to giving him or her the doctor's prescription with
your signature or stamp. The abstraction patient will go to the abstraction drug
store for their signature or stamp, and abstraction medicine from the store. The
appendix is based on the common pratice in human health.

### A-1

For Prof. $, in this tempo, convert the British sytle in a, b and c, back to the
American style in a, b, and c. The others choose: (1) both former and latter;
(2) either former or latter; (3) vary it. It implies the fixed or flexible style).
