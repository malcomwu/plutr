## Plan for milestones
1. One year, to release v1.0
2. After v1.0 publication, start the v2.0-delta together with the maintainence of v1.0.
3. Release v2.0.n-beta in the, three, year.

(In consideration)

## Development
- (tmp) Current version 0.1.0 (codename: carriage)
- The layout is two-by-two (2 x 2) as follows,
  ```
  +----+----+
  | 1> | 3? |
  +----+----+
  | 2$ | 4? |
  +----+----+ ,
  ```
  in which 1> refers to a console while 2$ a shell. The 3? and 4? are not defined yet.
- Toolchains: FreeDOS in DOS& and FreeBSD in tcsh within QEMU
- No network support in DOS for v1.0 while it is with tcsh.

&DOS stands for disk operation system.   // others are Brand&&CPU OS
                                         // Notolskrju example WinTel (kidding)
 the history is as follows: IBM-PC by PC-DOS; IBM found out Gates in garazu;
 IBM appricated Gates and also believe that he would not take over it.
 Gates, thus said, I am famous, untill now and still till-ing.
 IBM, therefore lost the PC domain who it led. By Willans and Taiwan mostly.
 Because we copy-cat your public specs of both hard-&firmwars, without
 touching your patterns. If touched, we hided it fairly well.% You agred. The
 reasons, we try try see it, and try try see you. You're dull; no reaction.
 (People's choice, (joke))

&%The techonology is so-called by-passing surgery, in which the public spec(s)
  are implanted with and within. It's hard-firm wares, you could not do the
  deasembler. You could do reverse engineering to check us out. You did not
  have time. I'm sorry to the Taiwaneses, thus, leaked. For the special-301
  act; however, we did very hard to follow you. The main reason is because
  we did not have money in a $ manner. However, if we had it, we still
  pirate you because we have learned the habbit for decades. I'm almost
  been released from you, by a Xrejected [Acept] Stemp-ed, with my proud!
